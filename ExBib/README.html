<h1>&epsilon;&chi;Bib</h1>

<p>
 &epsilon;&chi;Bib is a bibliography processor in the spirit of
 B<small>IB</small>TeX and B<small>IB</small>TeX&nbsp;8. It is meant
 to be usable as a plug-in replacement for those.
</p>
<p>
 In addition several attempts have been made to make it highly
 configurable.
</p>
<p>
 It is meant to be in line with <a
 href="http://www.extex.org">ExTeX</a>. Eventually it can be
 integrated into ExTeX or other tools. Thus the funtionality of the
 command line program is separated from the core functionality.
</p>

<h2>The &epsilon;&chi;Bib Installer</h2>

<p>
 &epsilon;&chi;Bib is delived in form of an installer. This installer
 is created with the help of <a href="http://izpack.org">IzPack</a>.
</p>
<p>
 IzPack is included in the folder
 <tt>ExBib-Installer/src/izPack-install-*</tt> since currently no
 reliable Maven2 package for IzPack could be found.
</p>
<p>
 The &epsilon;&chi;Bib installer can be created in this directory with
 the help of Maven2:
</p>
<pre>
  # <b>mvn package</b>
</pre>
<p>
This command requires that <a
href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven2</a> is properly installed on
your system and the executable can be found on the serach path.
</p>
<p>
After a succesful completion of the command the installer can be found
as the file <tt>ExBib-Installer/target/ExBib-setup.jar</tt>. This
installer includes everything needed to get started. It just requires
a proper Java installation (Java 5 or higher).
</p>
<p>
If the build fails the verbose log messages of Maven can be used to
determine the problem. Usually just reading the messages leads you
into the right direction.
