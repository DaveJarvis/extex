\chapter{Introduction}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

\ExTeX\index{ExTeX@\ExTeX} aims at providing a high-quality
typesetting system. The development of \ExTeX\ has been inspired by
the experiences with \TeX\ \cite{knuth:texbook}. The focus lies on an
open design and a high degree of configurability.

A tight integration of several components is one of the possibilities
opened by \ExTeX. To work into this direction \ExBib\ has been
implemented. It is a plug-in replacement for
\BibTeX~0.99c\index{BibTeX 0.99c@\BibTeX~0.99c}\ \cite{btxdoc,btxhak}
or \BibTeX~8\index{BibTeX 8@\BibTeX~8}.

\end{figure}
The principal interaction of a bibliography processor and a text
processor has been defined by \BibTeX\index{BibTeX@\BibTeX}. This is
depicted in figure~\ref{fig:files}. The unerlying communication
structure is file based. This scheme is supported by \ExBib\ as well.

The main input from the text processor is transfered in the aux file.
In \LaTeX\index{LaTeX@\LaTeX} (cf. \cite{lamport:latex}) the directive
\verb|\include| can be used to conditionally include parts of a
complete document. To make this work several aux files are written --
one for each fragment. This \ExBib\ has to cope with several aux
files.

The aux files contains the information on the databases to be used
and the bib style. Accordingly the databases and the style are read.

As a result of the processing a formatted list of database entries is
produced in a bbl file. Additionally logging information may be sent
to a log file.

The bbl file can be read in by the text processor to include the
entries into the document. This completes the cycle.

One cycle may not be enough to resolve all citations. If the database
entries contain references (in form of \verb|\cite|
macros\index{cite@\verb/\cite/}). Then they can be resolved in a
second round. Unfortunately this may theoretically continue ad
infinitum. Practically spoken this has not been ovsered in real life.
Most of time one cycle or at most two of them are sufficient.
