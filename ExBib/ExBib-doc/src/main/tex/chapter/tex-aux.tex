\chapter{Behind the Scenes}

\section{The \texttt{aux} File}


\IM{08x1} The selection of databases and entries in \ExBib\ is mainly
controlled by the \texttt{aux} file. The aux file is usually prouced
by \LaTeX\index{LaTeX@\LaTeX} and read by \ExBib. Since the aux file
is also used to communicate between successive runs of \LaTeX\ it can
contain information not relevant for \ExBib. This irrelevant
information is ignored.

Whenever the \texttt{aux} file is read the relevant information is
found by a strict pattern matching. The macros described below will be
recognized only if they are on a line by their own. Any characters
preceeding or following them on the same line will lead to the
skipping when the \texttt{aux} file is read.
