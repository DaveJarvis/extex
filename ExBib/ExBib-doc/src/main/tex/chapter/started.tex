\chapter{Getting Started}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

In this chapter we describe the steps you can take to get \ExBib\ up
and running. We try to use as few as possible premises. Thus it should
be not too hard to get started.

\section{Prerequisites}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

\subsection{Java}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

You need to have Java 5\index{Java} or later installed on your
system. You can get Java for a several systems directly from
\url{java.sun.com}. Download and install it according to the
installation instructions for your environment.

To check that you have an appropriate Java on your path you can use
the command \texttt{java} with the argument \texttt{-version}. This
can be seen in the following example:

\lstset{morecomment=[l]{\#}}%
\begin{lstlisting}{morecomment=[l][keywordstyle]{>}}
# java -version
java version "1.5.0_04"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_04-b05)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_04-b05, mixed mode)
#
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{TEXMF}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

If you want to use more than the pure \ExBib\ engine, styles can be
inherited from a texmf tree\index{texmf}. \ExBib\ itself does not
contain a full texmf tree. It comes just with some rudimentary files
necessary for testing and getting started. Thus you should have
installed a texmf tree, e.g. from a \TeX Live\index{TeXlive@\TeX Live}
installation. This can be found on the
\href{http://www.ctan.org}{Comprehensive \TeX\ Archive Network
  (CTAN)}\index{CTAN}.

There is no need to install the texmf tree in a special place. You
have to tell \ExBib\ anyhow where it can be found. It is even possible
to work with several texmf trees.

One requirement for the texmf trees is that they have a file database
(\File{ls-R}). \ExBib\ can be configured to work without it, but then
\ExBib\ is deadly slow. Thus you do not really want to try this
alternative.


\section{Getting \ExBib}

\subsection{Getting the Installer}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

The simplest way to get \ExBib\ up and running is to use the \ExBib\ 
installer. This installer\index{installer} is distributed as one file
\File{ExBib-setup.jar}. You can download it from

\begin{quotation}
  \url{http://www.extex.org/download/}
\end{quotation}

If you have got the installer there is no need for you to get the
sources as well. Nevertheless the soruces can be retrieved via
Subversion from
\begin{quotation}
  \url{https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/extex/trunk/ExBib}
\end{quotation}


\section{Installing \ExBib}\label{sec:install}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

The installation of \ExBib\ works with the \ExBib\ installer. This
installer is named \File{ExBib-setup.jar}. You can start the installer
with the following command line:\index{installer}

\begin{lstlisting}{}
# java -jar ExTeX-setup.jar
\end{lstlisting}

On Windows\index{Windows} with a properly installed Java\index{Java}
you can also start the installer by double-clicking
\texttt{ExBib-setup.jar} in the Explorer\index{Explorer}. This might
work on other windowing systems as well.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst1}\hfill
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst2}
  \caption{The Language Selection in the Installer}
  \label{fig:inst1}
\end{figure}
The installer provides a graphical user interface with a wizard
guiding you through the installation process. The first dialog is
shown in figure~\ref{fig:inst1}. As you can see you can select one of
several languages for the installation process. This selection just
effects the language used to communicate during the instanllation
process.  Currently the languages English and German are supported.
There might be some more at the time you are performing the
installation.\index{installer!language}\index{language!installer}

Note that the language selection covers the installer only. \ExBib\ 
can be run under different language environments as well. This is
controlled by a setting at run-time. Currently only an English and
a German language binding for \ExBib\ are provided.\index{language}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst3}
  \caption{Welcome to \ExBib}
  \label{fig:inst2}
\end{figure}

The next panel shows a welcome message showing what this installer is
about (see figure~\ref{fig:inst2}). Since you are reading this
document there is nothing new for you.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst4}
  \caption{Accepting the Licence}
  \label{fig:inst3}
\end{figure}

Now the license of \ExBib\ is presented (see figure~\ref{fig:inst3}).
It is there to remind you that there is something like a license. You
can not do everything with the software. But the limitations are very
minimalistic. Usually it should not really affect you -- especially
when you are migrating from \BibTeX.

Note that the license is the LGPL. In contrast to the GPL it does not
infect other software build from \ExBib\ or containing it.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst5}
  \caption{Selecting the Packages}
  \label{fig:inst4}
\end{figure}

Next the packages to be installed can be selected (see
figure~\ref{fig:inst4}). The core packages is needed in any case. Thus
it can not be deselected. The other packages can be freely choosen
from.

Whenever you select a package in the list a short discription of the
package is displayed.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst6}
  \caption{Selecting the Installation Directory}
  \label{fig:inst5}
\end{figure}

Finally the installation directory has to be selected (see
figure~\ref{fig:inst5}). The installation directory (see also
section~\ref{sec:inst.dir}) is the only directory the \ExBib\ 
installer creates files in. Usually is should be separate from other
directories. For instance the value \verb|C:\Program Files\ExBib| on
Windows or \verb|/opt/ExBib| on Unix are sensible values. Nevertheless
the installation can also be performed in your home directory if you
do not have writing permissions in the global directories.

This is the last decision you have to make.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst7}
  \caption{Progress of the Installation}
  \label{fig:inst6}
\end{figure}

Now the installation is performed. A progress panel is shown during
the installation (see figure~\ref{fig:inst6}). As a result the
installation directory is created and filled (see also
section~\ref{sec:inst.dir})

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/inst8}
  \caption{Saving the Installation Settings}
  \label{fig:inst7}
\end{figure}

When the installation is completed you get the chance to save the
settings for unattended replay (see figure~\ref{fig:inst7}). See
section~\ref{sec:replay} for details.


Finally you have to make sure that the executables \Prog{exbib} or
\Prog{exbib.bat} are on your path for executables.\index{path} This
can be achieved by modifying the environment variable \verb|PATH| in a
Unix environment or setting \verb|path| in the system settings on
Windows.


\subsection{The Installation Directory}\label{sec:inst.dir}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

During the installation you choose a directory where \ExBib\ lives.
This is called the installation directory. An example of the contents of the
installation directory can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:inst.dir}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
\begin{DirList}{200pt}{250pt}
  \TOPDIR(0,30){ExBib}
  \DIR(3,28)2{Uninstaller}
  \FILE(6,26)2{uninstaller.jar}
  \DIR(3,24){4.75}{bin}
  \FILE(6,22)2{exbib}
  \FILE(6,20){2.5}{exbib.bat}
  \FILE(6,18){2.5}{exbibutil}
  \FILE(6,16){2.5}{exbibutil.bat}
  \DIR(3,14){10.75}{doc}
  \FILE(6,12)2{exbib-manual.pdf}
  \DIR(3,10){4.75}{lib}
  \FILE(6,8){2}{ExBib-core.jar}
  \FILE(6,6){2.5}{ExBib-Main.jar}
  \FILE(6,4){2.5}{ExBib-styles.jar}
  \FILE(6,2){2.5}{ExTeX-resource.jar}
  \FILE(3,0){10.75}{LICENSE.txt}
\end{DirList}
  \caption{The Installation Directory}

  \label{fig:inst.dir}
\end{figure}

The directory \File{Uninstaller} contains the uninstaller. It can be
used to get rid of \ExBib\ -- even when I don't know why you should
want to. For details see section~\ref{sec:uninst}

The directory \File{bin} contains the binaries. This directory should
be put onto the path for executables. Note that currently all
executables are installed on any platform. On Windows the programs
without extension can be useful within the cygwin world. On Unix the
files with the extension \verb|.bat| can be simply ignored.

The directory \File{doc} contains documentation if the documentation
package has been selected during the installation.

The directory \File{lib} contains the libraries used by \ExBib.


\subsection{Replaying an Installation}\label{sec:replay}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

Sometimes it is desirable to perform an installation on several
similar machines. This means that the answers to the questions in the
installer are the same. This process can be automated.

In figure~\ref{fig:inst7} you can see the last screen of the
installer. Here you have the possibility to select the button
``Generate an automatic installation script''. This produces an XML
file which can be passed to the installer to avoid the
dialogs.\index{installer}\index{installation script}

Suppose you have named the file \texttt{replay.xml} in the file
selector which pops up when the button has been pressed. Then you can
replay the installation with the following command invocation:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
# java -jar ExBib-setup.jar replay.xml
\end{lstlisting}

This supposes that the two files \File{ExTeX-setup.jar} and
\texttt{replay.xml} are in the current directory.

\subsection{Uninstalling \ExBib}\label{sec:uninst}
%@author Gerd Neugebauer

The files installed by the installer (see section~\ref{sec:install})
can be removed from the system. For this purpose an uninstaller is
provided in the subdirectory \File{Uninstaller} of the \ExBib\
installation directory. It is named \File{uninstaller.jar}. It can be
invoked by double clicking or invoking it on the command line as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}{}
# java -jar uninstaller.jar
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/uninst1}
  \caption{Confirming the Uninstallation}
  \label{fig:uninst1}
\end{figure}

When the uninstaller starts it asks for configmation (see
figure~\ref{fig:uninst1}). Nothing is changed before the confirmation
is given.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{img/uninst2}
  \caption{The Uninstaller Finished}
  \label{fig:uninst2}
\end{figure}

The uninstaller shows a progress bar (see figure~\ref{fig:uninst2}).
When the uninstaller has finished its work all files and directories
installed with the installer have been removed. Modified and other
files are left untouched.

You can uninstall \ExBib\ by simply removing the installation
directory. But this is unsave since all local modification are lost as
well.
