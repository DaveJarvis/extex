\section{Groovy as Style Language}

An experimental feature of \ExBib{} is the replanceemnt of the BST
language by some other language for writing styles. Here the Bean
Scripting Framework (BSF) is used as adapter for other languages. Any
language made available this way can be plugged in with minor effort
as style language.

As an example the language Groovy has been made available this way.
