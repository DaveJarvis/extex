    This package contains the classes for the database of &epsilon;&chi;Bib and
    the entries stored in it.
    
    <h2>The Database</h2>
    <p>
      The database can mainly be seen as a list of entries. There are several
      methods to get hold of the information. See the documentation of the
      interface {@link org.extex.exbib.core.db.DB DB} for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interface {@link org.extex.exbib.core.db.DB DB} describes the
      capabilities of a database. The implementation details are hidden.
      Currently there is one implementation in
      {@link org.extex.exbib.core.db.impl.DBImpl DBImpl}. Nevertheless
      this class should not be addressed directly. Instead the factory 
      {@link org.extex.exbib.core.db.DBFactory DBFactory} should be used to get
      a new instance of a database.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Entries</h2>
    <p>
      The entries are the entities stored in a database.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Value Hierarchy</h2>
