    &epsilon;&chi;Bib is the B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X Compatible Database.
    It is an attempt to provide an implementation of a bibliographic database to
    be used with L<sup>A</suP>T<subE</sub>X and friends.
    
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    
    The development of &epsilon;&chi;Bib has been lead by several objectives.
    
    <ol>
      <li>&epsilon;&chi;Bib is the attempt to provide a Bibliographic Database
        which can be used as a plug-in replacement for 
        B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X in its command line version.
      </li>
      <li>The result of &epsilon;&chi;Bib in compatibility mode should imitate
        as much as possible the behavior of 
        B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X &ndash; for runs without errors or 
        warnings. This should be valid for the output file only. 
        &epsilon;&chi;Bib should not be concerned about the exact reproduction 
        of tracing messages or the contents of the log file.
      </li>
      <li>The compatibility mode should <emph>not</emph> be the default.
        The default mode should be the &epsilon;&chi;Bib mode, where certain
        extensions are provided and some curious design decisions of 
        B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X are not imitated.
      </li>
      <li>&epsilon;&chi;Bib should be configurable. This means that it should be
        possible to use different implementations of some of the core components.
        This could be used for example to mimic the behavior of 
        B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X 0.99c or 
        B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X 1.0 (as described in a TUGboat article).
      </li>
      <li>One objective of &epsilon;&chi;Bib is to provide a clean design which
        makes it easy to understand and enhance the program. As a result the
        whole program has to be structured into several components which are
        tied together with interfaces and factories.
      </li>
      <li>As implementation language Perl has been used for a first prototype. 
        Then the implementation language has been switched to Java to make use
        of the Unicode features of this languages as well as to be closer to a
        potential successor of T<subE</sub>X.
      </li>
      <li>The core components should provide a interface which make it possible
        to use them from within a typesetting engine without the need to use
        external aux files. Several passes within one run have to be taken into
        account.
      </li>
      <li>As much as possible the inherent knowledge about T<subE</sub>X should be
        eliminated.
      </li>
      <li>An easy update path should be provided for 
        B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X users: Old documents should be
        processable with the same results. Migration scripts should 
        provided whenever necessary.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Extensions</h2>
    
    The following extensions can be envisaged:
    <ol>
      <li>Implement the new features of B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X 1.0.</li>
      <li>Add new primitives to the BST language.</li>
      <li>Extend the syntax for B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X files
        <ul>
          <li>Allow structured description of names.</li>
          <li>Make provisions for multi-language entries</li>
          <li>Allow structured documents: i.e. articles in journals &ndash;
            without <tt>crossref</tt></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Integrate parsers for other bibliography formats
        <ul>
          <li>DocBook</li>
          <li>refer</li>
          <li>Endnote</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Bugfixes</h2>
    
    The following defects of B<small>IB</small>T<subE</sub>X should be cured:
    <ol>
      <li>No restriction on the sequence of entries in the database. 
        I.e. referenced entries may precede or follow the referencing entries.
      </li>
      <li>Better sorting has to be provided taking into account the various
        national conventions for sorting.
      </li>
      <li>No limit to some magical internal constants -- like the line length.</li>
      <li>The line breaking should not insert percents (%) but break at whitespace
        only.</li>
      <li>Bugfix: flush the output buffer at the end of the program and not only
        when <code>newline$</code> is encountered.
      </li>
    </ol>
