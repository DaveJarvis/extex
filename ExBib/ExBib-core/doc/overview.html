  &epsilon;&chi;Bib (or <tt>ExBib</tt> in pure ASCII) is a
  B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X-compatible database. It is an
  attempt to provide an implementation of a bibliographic database to
  be used with L<small
  style="vertical-align:top;">A</small>T<sub>E</sub>X and friends.

  </p>
    
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
    
  The development of &epsilon;&chi;Bib has been lead by several objectives:
    
  <ol>
    <li>The result of &epsilon;&chi;Bib in compatibility mode should
      imitate as much as possible the behavior of
      B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X &ndash; for runs without errors
      or warnings. This should be valid for the output file only.
      &epsilon;&chi;Bib should not be concerned about the exact
      reproduction of tracing messages or the contents of the log
      file.
    </li>
    <li>The compatibility mode should <emph>not</emph> be the default.
      The default mode should be the &epsilon;&chi;Bib mode, where
      certain extensions are provided and some curious design
      decisions of B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X are not imitated.
    </li>
    <li>One objective of &epsilon;&chi;Bib was to provide a clean
      design which would make it easy to understand and enhance the
      program. As a result the whole program has been structured into
      several components which are tied together with interfaces and
      factories.
    </li>
    <li>&epsilon;&chi;Bib should be configurable. This means that it should be
      possible to use different implementations of some of the core
      components. This could be used for example to mimic the
      behaviour of B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X 0.99c or
      B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X 1.0 (as described in a TUGboat
      article).
    </li>
    <li>As implementation language Perl has been used for a first
      prototype. Then the implementation language has been switched to
      Java to make use of the Unicode features of this languages as
      well as to be closer to &epsilon;&chi;T<sub>E</sub>X.
    </li>
    <li>As much as possible the inherent knowledge about
      T<sub>E</sub>X shoud be eliminated. If not possible it should be
      encapsulated in separate components to be exchangable.
    </li>
    <li>&epsilon;&chi;Bib should be multilingual in the sense that all
      messages produced by the system should be adaptable to a local
      language. As a proof of concept the languages English and German
      are supported right from the start.
    </li>
    <li>An easy update path sould be provided for
      B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X users: Old documents should be
      processable with the same results. Migration scripts should be
      provided whenever neccesary.
    </li>
  </ol>
    
  <h2>Extensions</h2>
    
  The following extensions can be envisaged:
  <ol>
    <li>Implement the new features of B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X
    1.0.</li>
    <li>Add new primitives to the BST language.</li>
    <li>Extend the syntax for B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X files
      <ul>
        <li>Allow structured description of names.</li>
        <li>Make provisions for multi-language entries</li>
        <li>Allow structured documents: i.e. articles in journals &ndash;
          without <tt>crossref</tt></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Implement the features of B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X8.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    
  The following defects of B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X should be
  cured:
  <ol>
    <li>No restriction on the sequence of entries in the database. 
      I.e. referenced entries may preceded or follow the referencing entries.
    </li>
    <li>Better sorting has to be provided taking into account the various
      national conventions for sorting.
    </li>
    <li>No limit to some magical internal constants &ndash; like the
      line length.
    </li>
    <li>Bugfix: flush the output buffer at the end of the program and not only
      when <code>newline$</code> is encountered.
    </li>
  </ol>
