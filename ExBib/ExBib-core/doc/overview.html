		BCD is the BibTeX Compatible Database.
		It is an attempt to provide an implementation of a bibliographic database to be used
		with LaTeX and friends.

		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		
		The development of bcd has been lead by several objectives.
		
		<ol>
			<li>The result of bcd in compatibility mode should imitate as much as possible the 
				behaviour of BibTeX -- for runs without errors or warnings. This should be valid for
				the output file only. bcd should not be concerned about the exact reproduction of
				tracing messages or the contents of the log file.
			</li>
			<li>The compatibility mode should <emph>not</emph> be the default.
				The default mode should be the bcd mode, where certain extensions are provided
				and some curious design decisions of BibTeX are not imitated.
			</li>
			<li>One objective of bcd was to provide a clean design which would make it easy
				to understand and enhance the program. As a result the whole program has been
				structured into several components which are tied togeter with interfaces and 
				factories.
			</li>
			<li>bcd should be configurable. This means that it should be possible to use different
				implementations of some of the core components. This could be used for example to
				mimic the behaviour of BibTeX 0.99c or BibTeX 1.0 (as described in a TUGboat article).
			</li>
			<li>As implementation language Perl has been used for a first prototype. 
				Then the implementation language has been switched to Java to make use of the
				Unicode features of this languages as well as to be closer to a potential successor of
				TeX.
			</li>
			<li>As much as possible the inherent knowledge about TeX shoud be eliminated.
			</li>
			<li>An easy update path sould be provided for BibTeX users: Old documents should be
				processable with the same results. Migration scripts should provided whenever neccesary.
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Extensions</h2>
		
		The following extensions can be envisaged:
		<ol>
			<li>Implement the new features of BibTeX 1.0.</li>
			<li>Add new primitives to the BST language.</li>
			<li>Extend the syntax for BibTeX files
				<ul>
					<li>Allow structured description of names.</li>
					<li>Make provisions for multi-language entries</li>
					<li>Allow structured documents: i.e. articles in jounals -- without <tt>crossref</tt></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Bugfixes</h2>
		
		The following defects of BibTeX should be cured:
		<ol>
			<li>No restriction on the sequence of entries in the database. 
				I.e. referenced entries may preceed or follow the referencing entries.
			</li>
			<li>Better sorting has to be provided taking into accout the various national conventions
				for sorting.
			</li>
			<li>No limit to some magical internal constants -- like the line length.</li>
			<li>Bugfix: flush the output buffer at the end of the program and not only when 
				<code>newline$</code> is encountered.
			</li>
		</ol>
