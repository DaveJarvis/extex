&epsilon;&chi;T<sub>E</sub>X is a bibliography processor developed in
the context of &epsilon;&chi;T<sub>E</sub>X.


<h1>&epsilon;&chi;Bib</h1>

<p>
&epsilon;&chi;T<sub>E</sub>X aims at providing a high-quality
typesetting system. The development of &epsilon;&chi;T<sub>E</sub>X
has been inspired by the experiences with T<sub>E</sub>X. The focus
lies on an open design and a high degree of configurability. A tight
integration of several components is one of the possibilities opened
by &epsilon;&chi;T<sub>E</sub>X. To work into this direction
&epsilon;&chi;Bib has been implemented. It is a bibliography processor
and can also be used as plug-in replacement for
B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;0.99c or
B<small>IB</small>T<sub>E</sub>X&nbsp;8.
