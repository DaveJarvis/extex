<body>
  This is the Command Line Interface description and parser.
  The main design goals are the following ones:
    
  <ul>
  <li>The parser should have as less knowledge as possible about how the
    command line should look like.
  </li>
  <li>The parser should be able to parse POSIX compliant command lines.
    Nevertheless the collation of single letter options is not considered
    to be essential.
  </li>
  <li>
    The description should be usable to produce a usage description for the
    online help.
  </li>
  <li>
    The parser should not contain any fixed texts. It should be possible to
    extract all needed strings from a resource bundle.
  </li>
  <li>
    The parser should support abbreviated forms of long options.
  </li>
  <li>
    The parser should use a callback-like interface to allow arbitrary code
    to be executed during the parsing.
  </li>
  </ul>
