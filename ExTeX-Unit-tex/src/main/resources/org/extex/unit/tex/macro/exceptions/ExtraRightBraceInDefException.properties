TTP.ExtraRightBrace=Argument of {0} has an extra '}'
TTP.ExtraRightBrace.help=I''ve run across a `'}''' that doesn''t seem to match anything.\n\
        For example, `\\def\\a#1{...}'' and `\\a}'' would produce\n\
        this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\\par'' that\n\
        I''ve just inserted will cause me to report a runaway\n\
        argument that might be the root of the problem. But if\n\
        your `}'' was spurious, just type `2'' and it will go away.
