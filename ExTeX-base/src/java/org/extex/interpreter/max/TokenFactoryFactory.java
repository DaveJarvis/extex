/**
 * This class provides a factory for a
 * {@link org.extex.scanner.type.token.TokenFactory TokenFactory}.
 * This factory inherits its properties from the
 * {@link org.extex.util.framework.AbstractFactory AbstractFactory}. Among them
 * the support for configuration and logging.
 *
 * <h3>Configuration</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 *  Mainly the configuration needs to specify which class to use for the
 *  TokenFactory. The name of the class is given as the argument <tt>class</tt>
 *  as shown below.
 *  <pre>
 *   &lt;TokenFactory class="org.extex.scanner.type.token.TokenFactoryImpl"/&gt;
 *  </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  The named class needs to implement the interface
 *  {@link org.extex.scanner.type.token.TokenFactory TokenFactory}. If
 *  this interface is not implemented an error is raised.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  The configuration is passed down to the new instance if it implements the
 *  interface {@link org.extex.util.framework.configuration.Configurable Configurable}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  If the class implements the interface
 *  {@link org.extex.util.framework.logger.LogEnabled LogEnabled} then a logger
 *  is passed to the new instance. For this purpose the factory itself is
 *  log enabled to receive the logger.
 * </p>
