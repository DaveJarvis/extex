 <h1>&ExBib;</h1>
 <p>
  &ExTeX; aims at providing a high-quality typesetting system. The development
  of &ExTeX; has been inspired by the experiences with &TeX;. The focus lies on
  an open design and a high degree of configurability.
 </p>
 <p>
  A tight integration of several components is one of the possibilities
  opened by &ExTeX;. To work into this direction &ExBib; has been implemented.
  It is a bibliography processor. It can be used as a plug-in replacement for
  &BibTeX;&nbsp;0.99c or &BibTeX;&nbsp;8.
