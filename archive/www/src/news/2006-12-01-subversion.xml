  <title>Repository moved to Subversion</title>
  <description>
    The repository of ExTeX has been moved from CVS to Subversion.
    Subversion seems to be the better choice to preserve history information
    during refactoring. A major restructuring of the sources is overdue and this
    is the first step in this direction.
