 <h1>#ExTeX() Testing</h1> 

 <p>
  #TeX() is accompanied by the trip test. This test tries to ensure that
  any system named &TeX; works properly. This means that it is a
  regression test suite.
 </p>
 <p>
  #ExTeX() needs a regression test suite which should ensure
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>that #ExTeX() properly provides the functionality of #TeX()
   for backward compatibility.
  </li>
  <li>that the functionality of #ExTeX() stays intact across
   versions of #ExTeX()
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Some test cases and a framework for testing is already present in #ExTeX().
  This is based on <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.
 </p>

 <h1>Wanted</h1> 
 <p>
  Several persons are wanted to cover different aspects of this important and
  time consuming tasks:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Someone with skills in #TeX() is required to write a bunch of
   additional test cases.</li>
  <li>Someone with skills in Java and #TeX() to code the test cases
   in <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Someone with skills in Java to regularly run the test cases
   and assign the problematic cases to maintainers of single pieces
   of code.
  </li>
  <li>Maybe someone with skills in <a href="http://www.maven.org">Maven</a>
   to automate the process.
  </li>
 </ul>
