The ExTeX Build System

  The ExTeX build system is based on Maven. The README.html files in the
  Maven projects explain who they can be build.

  In addition a nightly build is run to compile everything and produce the
  ExTeX web site. Details can be found in '''src/nightly-build'''.

  Some remainders of the old Ant-based build systems can be found here as well.
