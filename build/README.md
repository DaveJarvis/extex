εχ[T]{.t}[e]{.e}X Build System
==============================

The εχ[T]{.t}[e]{.e}X build system is based on Maven. The README.html
files in the Maven projects explain who they can be build.

In addition a nightly build is run to compile everything and produce the
εχ[T]{.t}[e]{.e}X web site. Details can be found in `src/nightly-build`.
See its [ReadMe](src/nightly-build/ReadMe.html) file for details.

Some remainders of the old Ant-based build systems can be found here as
well.
