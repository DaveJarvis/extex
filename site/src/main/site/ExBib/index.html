 <h1>#ExBib()</h1>
 <p>
  #ExTeX() aims at providing a high-quality typesetting system. The development
  of #ExTeX() has been inspired by the experiences with #TeX(). The focus lies on
  an open design and a high degree of configurability.
 </p>
 <p>
  A tight integration of several components is one of the possibilities
  opened by #ExTeX(). To work into this direction #ExBib() has been implemented.
  It is a bibliography processor. It can be used as a plug-in replacement for
  #BibTeX()&nbsp;0.99c or #BibTeX()&nbsp;8.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most of the features announced for #BibTeX()&nbsp;1.0 are implemented in
  #ExBib(): 
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>The command <tt>@include</tt> to control the inclusion of additional
  databases from within a #BibTeX() file. 
  </li>
  <li>The command <tt>@alias</tt> to assign more than one key to an entry.
  </li>
  <li>The command <tt>@modify</tt> to alter the fields of an entry.
  </li>
 </ul>
