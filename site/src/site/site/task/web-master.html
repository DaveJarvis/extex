 <h1>Maintaining the Web Pages</h1> 

 <p>
  The public relations work is rather important for any Open Source
  project. It is necessary to reflect the current activities and
  the progress to attract attention.
 </p>
 <p>
  #ExTeX() has some Web pages and a simple framework for their generation
  which need to be updated regularly.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Web pages are generated from simple sources &ndash; mainly HTML. This
  allows to separate the content from the layout. The building engine is 
  written in Java. It uses 
  <a href="http://velocity.apache.org">Apache Velocity</a> as templating engine.
 </p>

 <h1>Wanted</h1> 

 <ul>
   <li>Someone with skills in writing and HTML is needed to maintain the
    Web pages.
   </li>
 </ul>
