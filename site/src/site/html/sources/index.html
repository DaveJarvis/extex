 <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
 <p>
  #ExTeX() is implemented in Java. Thus a Java runtime environment at
  least in version 1.5.0 is required. Java can be downloaded from <a
  href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>. All other required
  libraries are part of the #ExTeX() distribution.
 </p>

 <h1>Sources</h1>

 <p>The sources are currently available via Subversion. See
  <a href="repository.html">[Repository]</a> for details.
 </p>
 <p>The sources might also be contained in the installer. They can be
  retrieved as package Source during the installation.
 </p>

 <h1>Stable Release</h1>

 <p>
  No binaries of the release 0.1 are available yet.
 </p>

 <h1>Snapshot</h1>
 <p>
  Snapshots of the development are provided on a daily basis.
  These snapshots may not serve any purpose and may not even be complete.
  The snapshot is distributed in one file
  <a href="$relativePath/snapshot/ExTeX-setup.jar">ExTeX-setup.jar</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  To install the snapshot run Java on the the file ExTeX-setup.jar. Depending
  on your operating system and your installation this can be achieved by
  double-clicking the file or by running the following command.
 </p>
 <pre>
  java -jar ExTeX-setup.jar  </pre>
 <p>
  The setup program is a graphical installer. Thus a graphical system
  is essential. Details of the installation and its steps can be found
  in the <a href="$relativePath/documentation/man/extex-users.pdf">#ExTeX() User's Guide</a>.
