  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  Here you can find some frequently asked questions &ndash; and
  their answers.

  <dl>
    <dt>Is #ExTeX() ready for use?</dt>
    <dd>#ExTeX() is still under development. When version 0.1 is
      released then you can consider it to be feature complete for the
      #TeX() compatibility mode. This means that DVI can be produced which
      is comparable &ndash; but not necessarily identical &ndash; to the
      DVI obtained from #TeX().
    </dd>

    <dt>Under which License is #ExTeX() distributed?</dt>
    <dd>The core part of #ExTeX() is distributed under the
     <a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.
     The documentation of #ExTeX() is  distributed under the <a href="fdl.html">Free 
     Documentation License</a>.
     Some libraries are used by #ExTeX() which come with their own licenses.
    </dd>

    <dt>How is #ExTeX() pronounced?</dt>
    <dd>The first syllable is pronounced ex as in expandable. And you
     know how to pronounce #TeX()...
    </dd>

    <dt>How is the #ExTeX() logo typeset?</dt>
    <dd>
      Here is the (#LaTeX()) definition of the logo for #ExTeX():
      <pre>
  \def\ExTeX{\textrm{% Logo always with serifs
    \ensuremath{\textstyle\varepsilon_{\kern-0.15em\mathcal{X}}}%
    \kern-.15em\TeX
  }}</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt>Which version of Java is required for #ExTeX()?</dt>
    <dd>#ExTeX() requires Java in version 5 or newer. Older versions
     will not suffice since generics are used extensively.
    </dd>

    <dt>Does #ExTeX() run under a "free" Java?</dt>
    <dd>#ExTeX() is developed with the Sun JDK and the Eclipse system.
     The last time we checked #ExTeX() did not compile with GCJ.
     If anyone is willing to work on a compatibility layer this
     help is welcome.
     <br/>
     On the other side SUN has released Java under an open source license.
     Thus this issue might no longer be of such a high priority.
    </dd>

    <dt>Can #ExTeX() be used as Java component?</dt>
    <dd>#ExTeX() has been designed with the application as library in
     mind. Thus interaction with the user or the environment are
     encapsulated and can be replaced. The command line interface is
     one example how to do it. The test driver for 
     <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> is also
     embedding #ExTeX() directly.
     <p>
     For a real application as library a texmf tree has to be present.
     An activity has been started in #ExTeX() to provide a texmf tree in the
     form of jar archives. Further volunteers are welcome.
