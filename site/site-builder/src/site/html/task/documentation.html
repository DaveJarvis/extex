 <h1>Documentation</h1> 

 <p>
  The end user of a program relies on the availability of proper
  documentation. The point of view of an end user is a different one
  from the point of view of an implementor. Thus it is highly desirable to
  have different people for implementing and documenting.
 </p>

 <h1>Wanted</h1> 
 <p>
  Maybe different people can cooperate to produce documentation in different
  languages:
 <p>
 <ul>
  <li>Someone with skills in writing and #LaTeX() is needed to
   produce end user documentation.
  </li>
 </ul>
