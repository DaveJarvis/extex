 <h1>#ExTeX() Debugger</h1> 

 <p>
  Debugging is a nasty task in #TeX(). What is missing is a modern debugger
  with all the possibilities we have in IDEs:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Single-step the execution</li>
  <li>Set break points</li>
  <li>Watch expressions</li>
  <li>Inspect the internal state</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  #ExTeX() is prepared for this task. Several points for observing the internal
  machinery and intervening are provided. On the other side the framework of
  Eclipse is well prepared to develop a debugger. This can lead to a
  #ExTeX() debugger with a graphical user interface.
 </p>
 <p>
  On both sides the debugger can rely on well-defined interfaces. On the
  #ExTeX() side requests for further functionality might be necessary. The
  debugger to be developed has to provide the glue code between the two
  worlds.
 </p>

 <h1>Wanted</h1> 

 <ul>
  <li>Someone with skills in Java and Eclipse to do the implementation.
  </li>
 </ul>
