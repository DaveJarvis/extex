  This package contains the ExIndex core. ExIndex is an index processor modeled
  after the <a href="http://www.xindy.org">Xindy</a> index processor.

  <h2>Components and Data Flow</h2>  

  <p>
   Index processing has the task to prepare an index. We consider index
   processing in the context of a document preparation system. The author
   prepares the document source in a way which allows it the document
   preparation system to extract the markup of the raw index entries. Now the
   index processor comes into play. It takes the raw index entries and
   arranges things in a structured index. This procedure is controlled by an
   index style. The structured index might be used bay the document preparation
   system to include it into the final document.

  </div>
  <p>
   This procedure is illustrated in the figure. This figure shows the source
   and intermediate results. Our view leaves it open where those data structures
   reside. In the classical scenario of TeX the intermediate data structures are
   stored in files. Nevertheless this needs not be true in any case. 
  </p>  
  <p>
   Form a user's point of view the index entries are marked in the document
   source. The construction of an index is a rather demanding task. Thus it
   needs a human intelligence at the beginning. Any attempt to automatically
   extract index entries without markup leads in general to a rather poor
   index.

  <p>
   The index processor reads in data of a raw index entry. It needs to
   determine where to put the index entry in the structured index. For
   this purpose a special key is constructed in several phases. The
   initial key read is called the main key. The main key is usually
   passed in explicitely or derived from a key passed in.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a first phase the main key is mapped to the merge key. The merge
   key is transformed into the sort key in a second phase. The sort
   key is then used to determine the letter group for the entry and to
   sort it amoung all entries.
