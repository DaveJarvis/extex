The εχIndex makeindex
=====================

εχIndex is an index processor.

Creating εχIndex makeindex
--------------------------

εχIndex makeindex can be created in this directory with the help of
Maven:

      # mvn package

This command requires that [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) is properly
installed on your system and the executable can be found on the search
path.

If the build fails the verbose log messages of Maven can be used to
determine the problem. Usually just reading the messages leads you into
the right direction.
